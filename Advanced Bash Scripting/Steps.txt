Steps-
1. Downloaded the cs253_assign_2.zip file from mookit.
2. Unzipped this file using the command : unzip cs253_assign_2.zip.
3. Opened terminal at the location of the unzipped folder and downloaded the covid_Data.json file in this folder using the commands :
wget https://api.covid19india.org/v4/data.json
mv data.json covid_Data.json
4. Created a shell script using the command : touch cs253_assign_2_190147.sh
5. This script contains the commands to access the downloaded covid_Data json file, along with the required comments for explanation (see cs253_assign_2_190147.sh)
I have deleted the state with code "TT" since it did not have any district, so I was not able to iterate on it using map(.). Hence, I deleted it using del(.TT)
6. Redirected the required outputs of this script to processed_Covid_Data_190147.csv file.
This file contains the <state>, <district>, <confirmed_cases>, <recovery_rate> fulfilling the conditions of task (27 entries).
