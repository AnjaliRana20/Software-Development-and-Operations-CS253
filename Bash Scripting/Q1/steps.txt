1. Unzipped the 1611338434_cs253_assign_1.zip file using unzip command : unzip 1611338434_cs253_assign_1.zip. 

2. Gave read, write and execute permission by the command: chmod 700 * 
(NOTE : Used * instead of file/folder name to give permission to all of them together rather than individually).

3. Created the directory 'Q1' using mkdir command. 

4. Moved the q1-cs253.tar.gz file into the Q1 directory using mv command. 

5. Then, Untar-ed the file q1-cs253.tar.gz using the command : tar -xvf q1-cs253.tar.gz
 
6. Unzipped the file  q1-cs253.zip using the command : unzip q1-253.zip

Two new files (5688bc90-ab36-4a02-b192-d2426572bc93.gz and deploy.gz) were created.

8. Gave r,w,x permissions to them by the command: chmod 700 *

9. Unzipped the files deploy.gz and 5688bc90-ab36-4a02-b192-d2426572bc93.gz using the commands: gunzip deploy.gz and gunzip 5688bc90-ab36-4a02-b192-d2426572bc93.gz 

Now, I see the deploy file which has to be executed. 

10. Ran the file 5688bc90-ab36-4a02-b192-d2426572bc93 using the command: ./5688bc90-ab36-4a02-b192-d2426572bc93 and got the output - 

package_name -> 1XgtRYXY6lt52de
Run the deploy script
The deploy script needs 4 parameters

11. Two new directories were formed in the last step. 
a. eE9sJwVniCjzoP6
b. XYBPlATIjqaMhys

12.Gave r,w,x permissions to them using the command :  chmod 700 *

14. Created 4 directories temp1, temp2, temp3, temp4 and passed them as arguments to the deploy (To get to know how arguments are to be passed to deploy). 

Output-
ls: cannot access 'temp1/*': No such file or directory
 temp2 SUCCESS 
ls: cannot access 'temp3/*': No such file or directory

That means the first and third args are directories, 2nd arg is package since SUCCESS is written after it and last is EMP ID.

15. So now, passed arguments to the deploy file using the command:
 ./deploy eE9sJwVniCjzoP6 1XgtRYXY6lt52de XYBPlATIjqaMhys 190147

Output:
Sat Jan 30 21:10:28 IST 2021 1XgtRYXY6lt52de SUCCESS 
[56e98bde-5c25-11eb-ae93-0242ac130002]
[2okrO-aWfLSEx-0WMBtMg]

which is of the same format as provided in the question.

16. Now ran the upper line with the directories interchanged
 ./deploy  XYBPlATIjqaMhys  1XgtRYXY6lt52de eE9sJwVniCjzoP6 190147

Output - 
5ahdx-JMfDG8L-NR8KNpi56e98bde-5c25-11eb-ae93-0242ac130002 iCzdcd0NKn2F9wW SUCCESS
[Sat Jan 30 18:30:01 IST 2021]

which doesn't match the correct format. 

Hence step 15 was the correct way to pass the arguments to deploy. 

17. Finally, ran the deploy again to redirect the final output message to the file submission-q1.txt. 
Did that using ./deploy eE9sJwVniCjzoP6 1XgtRYXY6lt52de XYBPlATIjqaMhys 190147
 > submission-q1.txt.
